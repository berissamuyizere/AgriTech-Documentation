                <h2>Purpose of AgriTech</h2>
                <p>Many farmers struggle to access farming machines on time due to manual processes and poor tracking
                    systems. <strong>AgriTech</strong> solves this by digitizing the entire process—from machine
                    ordering to usage and monitoring—ensuring transparency, traceability, and efficiency for everyone
                    involved.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Farmers:</strong> They can request machines from cooperatives and make payments.</li>
                    <li><strong>Cooperatives:</strong> Manage machine orders, make payments to suppliers, track
                        machines, and lend machines to farmers.</li>
                    <li><strong>Extension Officers:</strong> Conduct field visits and update machine conditions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Machine Suppliers:</strong> Receive machine requests from cooperatives and supply
                        machines.</li>

                <h2>FAQ</h2>

                <h3>For Farmers</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Q1: How do I know if my machine request has been approved?</dt>
                    <dd>A: You will receive an in-app notification once the cooperative approves your request.</dd>

                    <dt>Q2: What payment method is supported?</dt>
                    <dd>A: We use M-Pesa integration through the Daraja API for all transactions. You’ll be prompted to
                        complete payment from your phone.</dd>

                    <dt>Q3: Can I track the machine’s location?</dt>
                    <dd>A: No, but the cooperative can. They monitor usage through the tracking system.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>For Cooperatives</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Q1: How are geofence alerts triggered?</dt>
                    <dd>A: When a machine leaves its designated area, the IoT device sends a signal to the system, and
                        an alert appears in the dashboard.</dd>

                    <dt>Q2: Can I update the farmer’s details or reassign machines?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Yes. From the admin dashboard, go to the “Machinery” section and reassign as needed.</dd>

                    <dt>Q3: How do I record that a machine has returned?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Go to the lending record tab and mark the machine as returned manually.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>For Machine Suppliers</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Q1: How will I know when to supply a machine?</dt>
                    <dd>A: You’ll get a notification or request through the system once a cooperative places an order.
                    </dd>

                    <dt>Q2: How do I confirm delivery?</dt>
                    <dd>A: After delivery, log in and mark the request as “Delivered” in your supplier portal.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>For Extension Officers</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Q1: Can I update reports offline?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Yes. The mobile app stores data locally and syncs it once the internet is available.</dd>

                    <dt>Q2: Can I attach images to my reports?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Yes. During field reporting, you can upload photos, voice notes, or type notes.</dd>

                    <dt>Q3: How are reports used?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Reports are stored in the system and are visible to cooperatives for making decisions about
                        maintenance or retrieval.</dd>
                </dl>

                <h3>General</h3>
                <dl>
                    <dt>Q: What if I forget my password?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Use the “Forgot Password” option on the login screen to reset it via SMS.</dd>

                    <dt>Q: Can I use this app on any phone?</dt>
                    <dd>A: The farmer and extension officer apps are optimized for Android and can run on most
                        smartphones.</dd>

                    <dt>Q: Is AgriTech available in local languages?</dt>
                    <dd>A: Not yet, but Kinyarwanda support is planned for a future release.</dd>

                <h2>AI Component</h2>
                <h3>Purpose of AI in AgriTech</h3>
                <p>Artificial Intelligence plays a key role in helping cooperatives make smarter, faster, and more
                    informed decisions when sourcing machines from suppliers. Instead of relying on manual judgment, the
                    AI system analyzes data to recommend the best suppliers based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Historical delivery performance</li>
                    <li>Machine quality and condition reports</li>
                    <li>Supplier reliability</li>
                    <li>Timeliness of past deliveries</li>
                    <li>Extension officer feedback from the field</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <h4>Data Collection</h4>
                <p>The system gathers real-time and historical data from machine records, supplier logs, feedback
                    reports, and IoT tracking history.</p>

                <h4>Evaluation Model</h4>
                <p>A lightweight AI model (Agentic AI) processes this data to rank suppliers based on machine quality,
                    field performance, and overall reliability.</p>

                <h4>Recommendation</h4>
                <p>When a cooperative receives a farmer’s request, the AI suggests the top 1–3 suppliers most likely to
                    meet quality, speed, and reliability needs.</p>

                <h4>Learning Over Time</h4>
                <p>The more data it gathers, the smarter the system gets. For example, if one supplier’s machines
                    consistently break down or arrive late, their ranking is adjusted accordingly.</p>

                <h3>Future Improvements</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Automated fraud detection in supplier entries</li>
                    <li>Natural language query handling (e.g., “Find best supplier for dry season”)</li>
                </ul>
